        <!-- description -->
        <p>This chess pie is a very old <strong>Southern recipe.</strong> It's a very sweet, rich dessert which cannot be described as anything but marvelous.<br>
        This is not my personal recipe but was passed to me by my grandmother and from her grandmother and so on and so forth.<br>
        You will think you have died and gone to heaven when you taste this, especially when served with whipped cream.</p>
